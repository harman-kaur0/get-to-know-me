            I graduated last year from California State University, East Bay
            with B.S. Biochemistry. I was planning to attend a pharmacy school
            which led me to work at a pharmacy to get experience. However, down
            the road, I realized it is not something I am willing to do for the
            rest of my life. Hence, started looking for different options and
            came across programming languages. Slowly, I started self stuyding
            and decided to attended a bootcamp to help gain necessary skills to
            become a software Developer.
